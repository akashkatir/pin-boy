[337581] [ActionSystem] Tried to pop ContentController - Mailbox_Base(Clone) (Wotc.Mtga.Wrapper.Mailbox.ContentControllerPlayerInbox) but it does not exist in any stack. This could be because you've hidden a UI element twice in a row or hidden a UI element without showing it in the first place. You may need to rethink the show/hide mechanism of ContentController - Mailbox_Base(Clone) (Wotc.Mtga.Wrapper.Mailbox.ContentControllerPlayerInbox)
